        I am a software Engineer III at American Express. I have a passion for
        building accessible websites and am interested in game development. On
        my free time I love trying new restaurants, playing video games, and
        finding new shows to watch. I also enjoy painting, recently started to
        crochet, and am interested in getting back into ceramics. I also have 2 cats, Haru and Moose. I prefer to use the following technologies, Javascript, React.js/Redux, Node.js, SASS, Python.
